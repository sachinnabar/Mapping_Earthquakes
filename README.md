# Mapping_Earthquakes
Project Overview
•	The purpose of this project was to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. 
•	To complete this task, we used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved the geographical coordinates and magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days and used JavaScript and the D3.js library to plot this data visually. 
•	The Leaflet library was used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request that allowed for the visual creation and interaction of the earthquake data.

Summary
The data was able to be displayed correctly for "Earthquakes", "Major Earthquakes" and "Tectonic Plates". A new "Dark" overlay was successfully created and overlays and data projections functioned correctly.
